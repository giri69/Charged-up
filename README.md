Charged-up is a gym website that guides the conscious people who want to maintain their body.
It tells about the correct  postition and posture of each exercise and shows the most efficient manner of performing it.
It will surely improve your body reflexes and make you more quick.
We are also trying to integrate a very exciting feature that will take help of ioT which will keep a track of your body movements.
It will show how your body is moving and how it should move.
